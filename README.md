# agenticai-workshop
A starter kit for building basic AI agents with the Gemini API. Covers examples using LangChain, LangGraph, the Google ADK, and an MCP server.

## Getting Started 
### Get your Gemini API KEY
You can get a free Gemini API key for learning and development purposes directly from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
This key provides access to a generous free tier, which is perfect for learning, prototyping, and personal projects.

#### Here are the simple steps to get your key:

1. ##### Go to Google AI Studio:
Navigate to the official [Google AI Studio website](https://aistudio.google.com/).

2. ##### Sign In:
Sign in using your personal Google account.

3. ##### Agree to Terms:
If it's your first time, you will likely need to read and agree to the Terms of Service.

4. ##### Get API Key:
Once in the studio, look for a button or link on the left-hand side labeled "Get API key".

5. ##### Create API Key:
On the API key page, click the button that says "Create API key". You may be prompted to create a new Google Cloud project for your key. This is a standard step and is still part of the free process.

6. ##### Copy Your Key:
Your new API key will be generated and displayed. This is the only time you will see the full key, so copy it immediately.

### Important: Keep Your Key Secure
1. Treat your API key like a password. Never share it publicly.
2. Do not paste it into your code if you are sharing that code (e.g., on GitHub).

For projects, use environment variables to store your key securely.
